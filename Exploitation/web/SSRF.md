## Identify

1. Map all request parameters with URLs, IPs, Hostnames
2. Change the resource to something else and see how the application responds
If there are protections in place try some evading methods e.g.

### Black-List filter
- Using an alternative IP representation
-- 127.0.0.1
-- 2130706433 (decimal)
-- 017700000001
-- 0177.0.0.1
-- 7F00000 (hex)
-- 127.1. (0 are optional)
- Registering your own domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1. You can use spoofed.burpcollaborator.net for this purpose.
- Obfuscating blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.
 
### White-List filter
You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the @ character. For example:
https://expected-host@evil-host

You can use the # character to indicate a URL fragment. For example:
https://evil-host#expected-host

You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example:
https://expected-host.evil-host

You can URL-encode or double encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. 
You can use combinations of these techniques together. 

https://evilhost%23@expected-host.evil-host/admin/
 
3. Change the resources to some public resource that is under you control and look for incoming traffic (BurpCollaborator)
