# VLAN Hopping

VLAN hopping is used to assign an interface in a VLAN and hopping onto that in order to reach networks which are usually hidden.

## Yersinia

Yersinia is a framework for performing layer 2 attacks. It is designed to take advantage of some weaknesses in different network protocols. It pretends to be a solid framework for analyzing and testing the deployed networks and systems. Attacks for the following network protocols are implemented in this particular release:

* Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
* Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)
* Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)
* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
* Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)
* 802.1q
* 802.1x
* Inter-Switch Link Protocol (ISL)
* VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)

## Cisco's DTP

In Yersinia go to DTP and enable trunking. 

Then issue the following commands in the terminal
```console
modprobe 8021q  #Using 802.1q VLANs on Linux
vconfig add eth0.103  #Add interface
ifconfig eth0.103 up 
ifconfig eth0.103 192.168.103.29 #Set IP

#Remove it with vconfig when done using it
vconfig rem eth0.103
```
