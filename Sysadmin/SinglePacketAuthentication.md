### Single-Packet-Authentication

SPA is advanced port knocking. The client sends a specifically crafted, encrypted, non-replayable, and authenticated packet to the listening machine. This server does not expose the port that the client will eventually connect to but only open it for a brief period after receiving the specific packet. Afterwards, the port will be closed again but the already established connected stays intact. 
No open ports = No NMAP
