IP + Port = Socket

### iptables chains

**PREROUTING**
- Affects packets that just arrived
- No routing decision has been taken place
- Unknown if packet is interpreted locally or will be forwarded

**Routing**(not a chain)
- If the local machine is the recipient the packet is sent to the local process
- If the recipient is in a subnet, located at a different network interface it will be forwarded there

**POSTROUTING**  
- Before the packet leaves the machine get evaluated by the POSTROUTING chain
- Locally generated packets go through OUTPUT and then POSTROUTING


### NATing

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o internalInterface(eth1) -j MASQUERADE
