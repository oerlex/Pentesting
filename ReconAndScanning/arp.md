## ARP  
arp displays and modifies entries in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, which contains one or more tables that are used to store IP addresses and their resolved Ethernet or Token Ring physical addresses.  

```bash
arp -a // Displays current ARP cache tables for all interfaces
arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet
```
