### Enumerate local endpoints
Local endpoints are often not as good protected as external endpoints. They often disclose senstitive data without any authentication. It is hard to perform a complete analysis since we do not know what parameters the service is expecting.

We can:
1. Look at the code if available
2. TCP dump traffic to the application to find "real" requests. This will help us understanding what a request must look like.
```bash
tcpdump -i lo 'port 80'
```
3. Curl the endpoint and play with parameters
