## ARP  
arp displays and modifies entries in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, which contains one or more tables that are used to store IP addresses and their resolved Ethernet or Token Ring physical addresses.  
```console
arp -a // Displays current ARP cache tables for all interfaces
arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet
```

## NMAP
Some useful nmap commands  

### nmap -sn -PE 192.168.1.0/24
ICMP Echo Request (as specified by the -PE flag) to all hosts in 192.168.1.0/24

### nmap -A -sV -O -iL list-of-ips.txt  | tee recon-fingerprint.txt
* -sV = Version scanning
* -A = Version scanning
* -O = OS detection
* -iL = Input from List


### nmap -p- -sC -sV -oA 



### nmap -sP   
When this command runs nmap tries to ping the given IP address range to check if the hosts are alive. If ping fails it tries to send syn packets to port 80 (SYN scan). 
This is not hundred percent reliable because modern host based firewalls block ping and port 80. Windows firewall blocks ping by default.

### nmap -sP -P0
The -P0 flag skips the host discovery process and tries to perform a port scan on all the IP addresses (In this case even vacant IP addresses will be scanned). 
This will take a large amount of time but it will give you the results.

`sudo nmap -sP -PS22,3389 192.168.2.1/24 #custom TCP SYN scan`
`sudo nmap -sP -PU161 192.168.2.1/24 #custom UDP scan`
The better option would be to specify custom ports for scanning.  
Nmap allows you to probe specific ports with SYN/UDP packets. 
Probe commonly used ports e.g. TCP-22 (ssh) or TCP-3389 (windows remote desktop) or UDP-161 (SNMP). 

## Find default gateway
```console
ip r | grep default  
route -n  
netstat -r -n  
```

## Get public IP
```console
curl https://ipecho.net/plain  
wget -qO- https://ipecho.net/plain ; echo
```
## TCPDUMP
```console
tcpdump -i eth0 -w dump.txt	somehow  
tcpdump -n ----- shows ip addresses and ports  
```

## massscan
masscan is usually faster than nmap but provides no service detection  
`masscan -p80,8000-8100 10.0.0.0/8`
