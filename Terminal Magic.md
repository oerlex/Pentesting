# File Operations
This section contains resources on how to perform search operations in a Unix-based OS

### Recursive grep
Iterate through all files and subdirectories and look for the string specified.
```console
grep -r -i "mystring"
```

### See n lines before and after occurence of string
cat myfile.txt | grep dog -B 5 -A 5

### Find Files
```console
find . -type f -iname "*.txt" //Current subdirectory
find / -iname "#filename" //From root directory
or
locate #filename
```
### Replace defined characters with null
```console
cat myfile.txt | tr -d ‘.’
```

### CPIO Files
CPIO is a  file archiver utility and file format.
```console
cpio -iv < directory.cpio
```
### Show difference between files
```console
diff file1 file2
```
### Show file size in MB,GB,...
```console
ls -l --block-size=MB
```

### Use tail with updating end
tail -f filename

### Show size of mounted filesystem (df)
Shows the size, used space, and available space on the mounted filesystems of your computer.  
Two of the most useful options are the -h (human readable) and -x (exclude) options.  
```console
df -h -x squashfs
```

# User and Group Operations

### List all local groups which have users assigned to them
```console
cut -d: -f1 /etc/group | sort
```

### Show information about user (finger)
The finger command gives you a short dump of information about a user, including the time of the user’s last login, the user’s home directory, and the user account’s full name.
```console
finger
```

### Add SSH-Key to keychain
Add file to home-folder/.ssh/
```console
ssh-add -k keyfile
```

# Network Operations

### SOCKSv5 Proxy

ssh -D 1337 -N -C -q root@10.208.226.32
Set firefox proxy to socks5 and allow dns over it


### Add Temporary IP And Route
```console
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.X netmask 255.255.255.0  
sudo ip route add default gw 192.168.1.1  
route -n
```

### GUI programs in SSH
```console
ssh -X 
```
Run GUI programs such as firefox, burpsuite,...
In the ssh session type screen. In screen you can switch between session using  ctrl+a+c for a new “window" ctrl+a+n to switch to the next

### Dump all from FTP
```console
dump all files from an ftp
wget -m ftp://anonymous:a@10.208.226.11
```

### SOCKSv5 Proxy
```console
ssh -D 1337 -N -C -q root@10.208.226.32
Set firefox proxy to socks5 and allow dns over it
```
# openssl
Taken from https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html

Check private key
```console
openssl rsa -in privateKey.key -check
```
Check a certificate
```console
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout
```
Convert DER <--> PEM
```console
openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem
openssl x509 -outform der -in certificate.pem -out certificate.der
```
Convert a PEM certificate file and a private key to PKCS#12 (.pfx .p12) 
```console
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt -certfile CACert.crt
```

### Info about monitors/graphics devices (lspci/lshw)
```console
lspci -nn | grep '\[03'  
sudo lshw -c video
```

# Misc.

### Raise the elephant
The magic SysRq key is a key combination understood by the Linux kernel, which allows the user to perform various low-level commands regardless of the system's state. It is often used to recover from freezes, or to reboot a computer without corrupting the filesystem.Its effect is similar to the computer's hardware reset button (or power switch) but with many more options and much more control. 

The QWERTY (or AZERTY) mnemonics: "Raising Elephants Is So Utterly Boring", "Reboot Even If System Utterly Broken" or simply the word "BUSIER" read backwards, are often used to remember the following SysRq-keys sequence: 

On DELL computers SysRq = Fn
```console
Alt+SysRq+r  ( The LEFT Alt key ) ( SysRq is on the same button as print screen )
Alt+SysRq+s
Alt+SysRq+e
Alt+SysRq+i
Alt+SysRq+u
Alt+SysRq+b
```




### Check shared libraries
As an example we can check the shared libraries used by /bin/ls on a x86 Kali box
```console
root@kali:~# ldd /bin/ls
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffee17c7000)
	libselinux.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007ff50526c000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007ff5050ac000)
	libpcre2-8.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre2-8.so.0 (0x00007ff505027000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007ff505022000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007ff5052de000)
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007ff505001000)
```
