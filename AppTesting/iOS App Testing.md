## Jailbreak iOS
* 3uTools - http://www.3u.com/
* iMazing
* iFunbox
* Altstore

## Static Analysis
* Upload to mobSF and check result
* Unzip the iOS file and peek around

## Dynamic Analysis
Depending on the prerequisites there are different ways to setup the test environment.

### Non-Jailbroken device
Prerequisites:
- A Mac with XCODE (free version suffices)
- An iPhone
- Frida and Objection installed

Why do we need a MAC?
- XCODE can only be installed on MACOS
- We need a Developer Disk Image (DDI) is a dmg drive which gets mounted on your device in /Developer whenever you use Xcode.

1. Start XCODE and create an empty project
2. Go to project settings
3. Plug in the iPhone
4. Select the Phone in XCODE
5. Check the "Automatically manage signing" checkbox
6. Build and Run --> embedded.mobileprovision on disk
7. In your iPhone you have to trust the app in the device settings otherwise this error will likely to appear after the first run "Settings App -> General -> Profiles & Device Management -> Select your iTunes account from the "Developer App" section -> Select "Trust""
8. Install the dependencies required for patching the .ipa
AppleSign
```console npm install -g applesign```
DyLib
```console git clone https://github.com/Tyilo/insert_dylib
cd insert_dylib
xcodebuild
cp build/Release/insert_dylib /usr/local/bin/insert_dylib
```
Others
```console
brew install p7zip
```
9. Find the signature ```console security find-identity -p codesigning -v```
10. Patch!  ```console objection patchipa — source ./myapp.ipa — codesign-signature SIGNATURE
11. Move the patched ip to Kali

From Kali 
```console
sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice  
sudo apt-get install ideviceinstaller  
ideviceinstaller -i <Path_to_your_ipa> 
idevicedebug -d run com.dingdong.myapp
objection explore
```

### Useful Links
Objection - https://github.com/sensepost/objection
objection is a runtime mobile exploration toolkit, powered by Frida. It was built with the aim of helping assess mobile applications and their security posture without the need for a jailbroken or rooted mobile device.

Check my notes @ https://gihttps://github.com/oerlex/Pentesting/edit/master/AppTesting/objection.md

First we need to patch the ipa file
