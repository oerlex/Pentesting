### Ways of working Whitebox Test

For the most part, we get code, and credentials. so the first thing you want to establish is how the flow of the application goes form the first second you interact with it. 

1.  **Sources/Entrypoints:**  This is where the user can enter data into the application, in an http application this are the endpoints

2. **Sinks:** This is a potentially vulnerable point in the code, f.e. a strcpy

The idea is to find a path from a source that allows user controlled data to end up in a sink.

Generally:
1. Get a graps how the application works
2. Look at the traffic
3. Burp/Code Follow application flow paraleell to clicking the GUI
4 When things are a bit more complicated, like having multiple servers and components, I usually like to research into de configuration of the servers, as many bugs and misconfigurations can be found rather quickly at times
